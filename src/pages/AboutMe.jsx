                <p>Hello, thanks for stopping by my About Me page! I am pleased to bring this app to you since we weren’t allowed to have fun in 2020. So I hope you find the functionality of the Post Covid Worldwide Concert Tracker. Although I do not go to concerts and live shows myself, I do see a need for this application since so much of the world does go to live music events. "Necessity is the mother of all invention" - Plato; I couldn't agree more. Roman philosopher Seneca once said, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity." I am certain this is the preparation phase that will deliver some luck since the global sentiments on covid are relaxing in some places and the people want to travel. I would even venture to say that over the next few years, the travel industry is going to boom. Live music is one of the branches that make up the vast entertainment industry, and this is my chance to break in, make a place for myself, and grow. Grow along with me, and be a part of the change in the way we engage with the future, the 1st baby steps being this app. </p>
